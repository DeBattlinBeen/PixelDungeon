# Pixel Dungeon
A dungeon-crawler game in a pixel art style created for android mobile.

Pixel Dungeon was a passion project made by a team of two Irish students, [@Conor Beenham](https://github.com/beenham) and [@JackG049](https://github.com/JackG049), studying Computer Science.
The app has not yet been fully released due to the return of the semester, but will continued to be worked on in our spare time!

## What is it?
Pixel Dungeon involves the player exploring, and attempting to escape dungeons.
Traverse the trap-filled dungeons, collecting loot and solving puzzles, including, *The Classic "Simon" Game*,
*A Coloured Gems Puzzle*,
*A Random Portal puzzle*,
*and more!*
The Loot found within the dungeons can be used to by different characters skins and items to help you out in your adventures!

## Features
Pixel Dungeon includes many of Google Play Games' features such as Achievements, Leaderboards and Cloud Saves.
This brings a sense of challenge and life to the game when competing for the top spot or that 100% Achievemnt goal!
